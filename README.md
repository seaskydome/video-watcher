# Video Watcher

## How to use
Enter a video title in "alias" and video URL or ID in the "URL" box.
Then, click "Add" to add it to the list. Click on any video to watch it.
Click "remove" to remove a video. You can search the videos based on the
alias (case insensitive). If you click add and nothing happens, make sure:
1. both fields are filled out 2. you provided a valid url/id 3. your search
is clear

## Why i made this
I wanted to be able to watch videos without going through youtube.com.
The official website can be way too distracting, so i use this. For
maximum effectiveness, make sure youtube.com is blocked using a site 
blocker. This website will still be able to play videos.
